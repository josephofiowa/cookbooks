You can use computer vision to identify shipping containers on intermodal containers and read container and chassis IDs.

This repository contains code you can use to identify shipping containers, read characters on each container, and show predictions in a video.

This project is written to pair with the [How to Build a Yard Management System with Computer Vision](https://blog.roboflow.com/yard-management-computer-vision/) guide. The guide contains instructions on how to use this project.

# Monitoring Stacks of Boxes with Email Notifications
Use the Roboflow API and Jetson Nano docker container to monitor items of interest with email notifications. The code in this repository detects 
stacks of three or more packages (deemed potentially unsafe) and sends email notifications when detected. [Roboflow Blog Post](https://blog.roboflow.com/object-detection-jetson-nano-python/).
